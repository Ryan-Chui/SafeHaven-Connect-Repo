# SafeHaven Connect

**Emergency Response Coordination Platform**

SafeHaven Connect is a dual-portal emergency response platform that bridges the communication gap between emergency shelters and first responders during crisis situations. When infrastructure is compromised, this platform provides a reliable way for shelters to report their critical needs and for emergency responders to coordinate supply distribution effectively.
